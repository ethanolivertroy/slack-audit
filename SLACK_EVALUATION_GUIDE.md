# Slack FedRAMP and NIST 800-53 Compliance Evaluation Guide

This guide provides a systematic approach to manually evaluate a Slack workspace for FedRAMP and NIST 800-53 compliance, complementing the automated `slack_audit.py` script. It follows the assessment areas from the script but provides step-by-step instructions for a hands-on evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning your evaluation, ensure you have:

1. **Administrative access** to the Slack workspace being evaluated
2. **API tokens** with appropriate permissions:
   
   To create the required tokens:
   - For standard workspace token: Go to **https://api.slack.com/apps** → Create New App → From scratch
   - Name your app (e.g., "Compliance Audit") and select your workspace
   - Under "OAuth & Permissions", add the following scopes:
     * `admin`
     * `team:read`
     * `users:read`
     * `channels:read`
     * `groups:read`
     * `im:read`
     * `mpim:read`
     * `files:read`
     * `apps:read`
   - Install the app to your workspace
   - Copy the OAuth User Token (starts with `xoxp-`) and Bot Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
   
   Export the tokens:
   ```
   export SLACK_API_TOKEN="xoxp-your-user-token"
   export SLACK_ADMIN_TOKEN="xoxb-your-bot-token" # For admin operations
   ```

3. **Required tools**:
   - Command line with `curl` and `jq` installed
   - Web browser for Admin Console access
4. **Documentation** of your organization's security requirements

**Note:** For Enterprise Grid, additional admin scopes may be required to access organization-wide settings. Work with your Slack admin to obtain a token with the appropriate enterprise permissions.

## Enterprise Grid Requirements for FedRAMP

For FedRAMP compliance, particularly at the Moderate or High impact levels, Slack Enterprise Grid is typically required. Key features include:

- **Enterprise Key Management (EKM)**: Customer-managed encryption keys
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Integrated content scanning
- **Enhanced Audit Logs**: More comprehensive than standard workspaces
- **SAML-based SSO**: Required for authentication
- **Custom Session Duration**: For session management
- **Network Controls**: IP allow listing and domain restrictions
- **Mobile Device Management**: Via Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)
- **Organization-wide Policies**: Consistent security enforcement

When evaluating Slack for FedRAMP compliance, confirm with Slack that your instance is deployed within their FedRAMP authorized environment.
